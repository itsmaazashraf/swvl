# PROJECT INFORMATION

Swvl is a provider of tech-enabled mass transit solutions, offering intercity, intracity, B2B, and B2G transportation products and services. Swvl operates in 135 cities in 20 countries across Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia


# REQUIREMENTS

The concept of swvl was derived from the fact that there wasn't any proper platform that suggested a more lenient way for B2B transits to pursue upon. Or even using it from a common traveler’s point of view from transiting from one area to another. Swvl provides ride-hailing services with a focus on mass transit. Using the app, customers can reserve and pay for rides on private buses operating on fixed routes. The company’s proprietary algorithm uses the passenger’s location and destination to calculate the quickest trip time. The services provide reliable alternatives to public transportation without the expense of individual ridesharing options. The technology also allows for more efficiency than public transportation, which results in lower emissions. Swvl also provides inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services.
